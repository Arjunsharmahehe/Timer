# Timer 
Runs a timer in the terminal/console and ***plays the alarm sound*** when it finishes.

### Pre-requisite
Install the ***playsound module***
```
pip install playsound
```
- This module ***can't be installed in newer versions of Python***. If you want to use this module, you'll have to use Python versions like ***3.7/3.8***
- You can read the documentation for further context --> https://pypi.org/project/playsound/

### Key Learnings
- How to manipulate the terminal into refreshing and printing the output on the same line instead of every iteration being printed in a new line
